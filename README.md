Numerical Analysis is a Mathematics course for engineers and scientists, and it is designed to provide Mathematics procedures for determining approximate solutions to certain problems that arise in science and engineering. So this course is a basic course on Numerical Analysis, and it provides the theory and application of numerical algorithms which help one to determine approximate solutions of problems such as evaluation of definite integrals or solution of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, and so on. Such approximations are needed because analytical methods are either intractable or the problem under consideration may not be solvable by analytical techniques.
